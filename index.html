                <p>I am currently self-learning several programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. I do, however, recognise the invaluable benefits of on the job training and I am keen to connect and work with industry experts to develop both technical and professional skills.</p>

                <p>After over a decade in UKâ€™s Water Industry as a Civil Engineer I decided to change my career path and
                    explore pastures new. For a detailed employment history please visit my

                <p>A wide range of responsibilities were trusted upon me throughout my career in Civil Engineering, from the solution development using hydraulic modelling to the final preparation and submission of various tenders, contract documents and specifications including detailed design drawings.</p>

                <p>I have worked closely with clients, multidisciplinary teams and colleagues based in different departments, offices and countries. These opportunities enabled me to understand the need to vary written and verbal styles to suit the situation and recipient of the information. I am experienced in chairing meetings with clients and external stakeholders.</p>

                <p>I am comfortable working in a team or unaided with minimum supervision, but I know when to ask for help. I am also keen to help others where I can use my skills, knowledge and experience. I recognise the concept of teamwork in a wider sense, extending beyond the limits of my own team when working on projects involving internal and external clients.</p>

                <p>Throughout my career I acted as a mentor to junior staff and have been responsible for establishing and training an offshore modelling team. I spent three months in India developing inter-country working arrangements and building relationships. I was responsible for preparing and delivering hydraulic modelling training to twelve Graduate Engineers.</p>

                <p>Most hydraulic modelling projects consist of a large-scale planning, acquisition and data management to match models to real world monitoring records of asset operations, flows and rainfall. I led on the development of new tools and techniques to optimise and automate the modelling processes, mainly using MapInfo GIS software and their MapBasic programming language.</p>

                <p>My recent experience involved preparing and evaluating tenders, and the detailed design of several projects located on the Island of Jersey, including the design of the new sewage treatment works (

                    ). I was also responsible for building a new 3D model and visualisation of the proposed works, the final video visualisation is available

                <p>On a personal level like for many of us it was a challenging year, but as a family we managed to enjoy spending more time with our little one and getting my four-legged friend exhausted while exploring local woods. Once the World opens again, I am looking forward to spending time with my friends and family, using my football season ticket and travelling.</p>

                <p>Many thanks for taking time to read my profile and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
